            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
            Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without 
            requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people
            and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, 
            or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously 
            ill or die at any age. 
        </br>
        </br>
            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus 
            spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a
             properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s
            your turn and follow local guidance.
        </br>
        </br>
            The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, 
            sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. 
            It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay 
            home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

        <ul>
            <li>Get vaccinated when a vaccine is available to you.</li>
            <li>Stay at least 1 metre apart from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.</li>
            <li>Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible or when in poorly ventilated settings.</li>
            <li>Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.</li>
            <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
            <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
            <li>If you feel unwell, stay home and self-isolate until you recover.</li>

        <p>Because the virus spreads from person to person, it's important to limit your contact with other people as much as possible. and avoid large gatherings. Many states and cities have eased restrictions but this doesn't mean the virus is gone. Continue to follow safety practices such as wearing a cloth face mask in public places and washing your hands.

            While many companies continue to use work-from-home practices, that is not possible for a lot of workers. Some people work in “essential businesses” that are vital to daily life, such as health care, law enforcement, and public utilities. Everyone else should continue to limit your time in public as much as you can and wear a cloth face mask when you can't. 
            
            The following terms have now become commonplace:
            
            Social distancing or physical distancing, keeping space between yourself and other people when you have to go out
            Quarantine, keeping someone home and separated from other people if they might have been exposed to the virus
            Isolation, keeping sick people away from healthy people, including using a separate “sick” bedroom and bathroom when possible
            Precautions should still be followed even if you are vaccinated.</p>
